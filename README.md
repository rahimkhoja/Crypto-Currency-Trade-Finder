## What is Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based interactive computing platform that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's often used in data science and machine learning, but it can be used in many other domains as well.

High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of supercomputing systems to solve complex computational problems. Jupyter Notebook can be used in conjunction with HPC systems to perform computationally intensive tasks. For example, you can use Jupyter Notebook to write code that runs on a cluster of HPC machines to process large datasets. This can be useful when you need to perform a large number of calculations in parallel or when you need access to more computational resources than a single machine can provide.

In conclusion, Jupyter Notebook is a tool for interactive computing and data analysis, while HPC is a field that involves using powerful computing systems to solve complex problems. The two can be combined to perform complex computations on large datasets, making Jupyter Notebook a valuable tool for HPC applications
